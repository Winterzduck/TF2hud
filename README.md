# "Ace" hud
This was the most up to date version of Hudas Iscariote (original edit by Mangachu then maintained by Aegis.) As the original HUD developer stopped work I have to decided to finish this HUD and maintain it.

#To Do List

Fix Active Timer

Remove Sentry Icon On CSpectatorTargetID And CSecondaryTargetID

Fix TargetID Border Chopped Of

Fix Icons On The Main Menu

Add Back The Original Boxs Around Health And Ammo

Add Option For Player Model

Finish Comp Mode

Update ClientScheme (Fix Colors)

Edit the hudlayout.res to your liking. The Fog crosshair "2" is enabled by default, so make sure to use crosshair 0 in TF2.  

The included scoreboards are:
* 16v16 for pubs 
* 9v9 for minmode 1

Included crosshairs:

* Rainbow_Konr wings
* Quartz Crosshairs
* Fog Crosshairs
* Garm3n crosshairs

This HUD is intended for 16:9. Clipping and overlaping happens on 4:3, it is also suggested to change the sizes of the crosshairs as they are very big on 4:3 screens.
