# "Ace" hud
Re-edit of Hudas Iscariote (by Mangachu) for Team Fortress 2.

Edit the hudlayout.res to your liking. The Fog crosshair "2" is enabled by default, so make sure to use crosshair 0 in TF2. There is currently very little customizability due to this project being a personal HUD. 

The included scoreboards are:
* 16v16 for pubs 
* 9v9 for minmode 1

Included crosshairs:

* Rainbow_Konr wings
* Quartz Crosshairs
* Fog Crosshairs
* Garm3n crosshairs

The current release features a fixed winpanel.res for servers with supplemental stats (avatars + killstreaks), and a slightly different font for the menu.
